# Mini microservices Blog app
## What is a microservice?
We will first review how you're probably building servers right now.
so right now youre probably familiar with Monolithic architectures.
this is how youre probabbly building servers right now.
in a monotlithic server we have all of our code needed to implement our application inside of one single code base, and we deploy this code base in one descrit unit.
so we might imagine that with monolithic server, there is a req that coming from a user device that will flow into our application and maybe go throguh preprocessing middleware and maybe goes off then to some router and that router might then inspect request and decide to send off to some very specfic feature for that process, for example goes to feature A, feature A might decide to read/write some data to db eventualy formulate response, and then send the response to who ever made the request.
so if we had to characterize a monolithic server we might say the following we might summarize it with this sentence, we might say that monolithic contains all the routing all the midddlewares all the business logic and all the db access code required code required to implement all features of our application. so that will charactrized a monolithic server. 

## Is Microservices the only architectural pattern?
There are several architectural patterns for building applications beyond microservices. Here are a few:

1. **Monolithic Architecture**:
   - **Description**: A single, unified codebase where all components of the application are interconnected and run as a single service.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for small to medium-sized applications with limited complexity. Easier to develop, test, and deploy initially.

2. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - **Description**: An application is divided into smaller, independent services that communicate over a network. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for large, complex applications that require scalability, flexibility, and independent deployment of services.

3. **Serverless Architecture**:
   - **Description**: Applications are built using third-party, cloud-based services where the cloud provider manages the server infrastructure. Functions are executed in response to events.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications with variable workloads, where you want to minimize infrastructure management and pay only for actual usage.

4. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**:
   - **Description**: Similar to microservices, but services are typically larger and communicate through an enterprise service bus (ESB).
   - **Use Case**: Used in large enterprises where integration of various services and legacy systems is required.

5. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - **Description**: Components of the application communicate through events. An event bus or message broker is often used to handle the events.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications that require real-time processing and decoupled components, such as IoT systems or real-time analytics.

6. **Layered (N-Tier) Architecture**:
   - **Description**: The application is divided into layers, each with a specific responsibility (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).
   - **Use Case**: Commonly used in enterprise applications to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

7. **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**:
   - **Description**: Focuses on the core business logic, with external dependencies (e.g., databases, UI) connected through ports and adapters.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for applications that need to be highly maintainable and testable, with a clear separation between business logic and external systems.

Each architecture has its own strengths and is suitable for different types of applications and organizational needs. The choice depends on factors such as application complexity, scalability requirements, development team size, and deployment strategies.
